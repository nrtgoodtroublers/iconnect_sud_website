                        <h3>Version 1.1.26</h3>
                        <b>Effective 2026-01-12</b>
                        <p>The Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions at George Mason University built iCONNECT to be used as a free application (henceforth referred to as ‘Service’). This Service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
                        <p>This document (henceforth referred to as ‘Policy’) was developed to inform visitors about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information while using our Service.</p>
                        <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this Policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at iCONNECT unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>



                        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
                        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information, including, but not limited to, full name, email address, and occupational role. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>Please also note this Service uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>



                        <h3>Log Data</h3>
                        <p>In the case of an application error while using our Service, we may collect data and information through third-party products on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include specific information about your device, such as its name, Internet Protocol address, and operating system version, in addition to your application configuration at the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>



                        <h3>Location Data Collection</h3>
                        <p>iCONNECT collects location data only when the app is active to display the nearest available resources based on your current location. This data helps us provide accurate information about the resources closest to you, enhancing your user experience.</p>



                        <h3>Data Sharing</h3>

                        <p>Your location data is not shared with third parties, except for necessary services (e.g., map providers) to deliver location-based functionality. We take precautions to ensure your data is secure and not used for advertising purposes.</p>



                        <h3>User Control</h3>

                        <p>You can manage or disable location access through your device's settings. Please note that disabling location services may limit the app's ability to show nearby resources.</p>



                        <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These data are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
                        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, it may utilize third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, then you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.



                        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
                        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                        </ul>



                        <p>These third parties may have access to your Personal Information in order to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated to not disclose or use this information for any other purpose.</p>



                        <h3>Security</h3>
                        <p>We value your trust in providing your Personal Information to us. Although no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure and reliable, we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your information since we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>



                        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
                        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>



                        <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
                        <p>This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from individuals under 13 years of age. If we discover that such an individual has provided us with personal information, then we will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.</p>



                        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to periodically review this page for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
                        <p>This policy is effective as of 2023-07-11.</p>
